# wanderingbird

This Finch robot script makes the Finch wander around and when it detects an obstacle with it's IR sensors, the Finch backs up
for a bit and continues forward.

You will need a Finch robot, the [Finch Python software](http://finchrobot.com/software/python), and Python 2.7 or higher!

The program was written in Python, but the Finch is programable in dozens of languages, i.e. C, C++, C#, Java, Go, and many more.

Don't have the [Finch robot?](http://finchrobot.com)
Don't have [Python??](http://python.org)
